I remember the day when you came in to teach GetModern during my boot camp and look how far we have come. You have always believed in letting your work do the talking for you and this is something I have personally learnt from you. It is an absolute pleasure to have you as a teacher, a senior to lean on and now a manager to lead us to new frontiers. Huge Congratulations on this new phase of life ! Lots of Love from the entire team and Happy Women's Day!</span>
